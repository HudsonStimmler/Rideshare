PROJECT TITLE: RideShare
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Determine fare amount made by driver
VERSION or DATE: 02-07-2022
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Run the Road.java file
AUTHORS: Hudson Stimmler & Julian Harrison

This program simulates a ride sharing system where passengers are created at different stations, a car passes through and picks them up if the car is going to continue through their destination, and eventually drop them off at their destination. It also keeps track of a fare (ten dollars per mile travelled per passenger).

To run the original problem with 4 passengers go to Road.java. Road100.java runs the same simulation but with 100 initial passengers.

First, we started with Car.java which created a car. Then, we moved onto Passenger.java, to Station.java, and finally created Road.java [and Road100]. The overall system of movements is orchestrated through a series of for loops. 

There are 31 possible stations and a single car, although bost of these amounts could be changed and still work. Comments are included throughout explaining the functions of each method.
